{"word[0]":"Groundhog Day","definition[0]":"If one day seems very like another, people sometimes say that it is like Groundhog Day, a film in which the main character has to live the same day (2nd February) many times. In the US, according to old stories, the groundhog comes out of its hole on this day for the first time since winter began. If it sees its shadow, it is frightened back into its hole and there will be six more weeks of winter, but if it is cloudy and there is no shadow, there will be an early spring."}

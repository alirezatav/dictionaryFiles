{"word[0]":"Starr, Kenneth","definition[0]":"(1946–) a US lawyer who in 1994 was given the job of ‘independent counsel’, to find out the truth about various claims made against President Clinton, including claims that he was involved in dishonest business activities and that he had had secret sexual relationships with several women. Some people criticized Starr for spending too much time and public money to find out all the facts, because they believed these had no effect on Clinton’s ability to do his job well."}

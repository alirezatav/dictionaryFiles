{"word[0]":"David, King","definition[0]":"( died around 962 BC) in the Old Testament of the Bible, one of the kings of Israel, who is also believed to have written some of the Psalms. His friendship with Jonathan is thought of as an example of a perfect, loyal friendship between two people. When David was a boy, he killed the  giant (=a very tall, strong man) Goliath by hitting him on the head with a stone thrown from his  sling. People sometimes use the names David and Goliath to describe a situation in which a small and less powerful person or group is fighting a much larger and more powerful person or group."}

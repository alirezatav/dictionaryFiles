{"word[0]":"George I, King","definition[0]":"(1660â€“1727) the king of Great Britain and Ireland from 1714 until his death. He was born in Germany and spent most of his time there, and he never learned to speak English. This made him very unpopular, and his lack of interest in government led to Britain having its first prime minister."}

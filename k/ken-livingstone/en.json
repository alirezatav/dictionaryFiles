{"word[0]":"Livingstone, Ken","definition[0]":"(1945–) a British politician who was the Labour leader of the Greater London Council (GLC) in the 1980s. He was popular with ordinary people but disliked by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who eventually closed down the GLC. He was a Labour MP for several years, and was on the left wing of the party. In 2000, he was expelled (expel) from the party because he wanted to stand in the election for mayor of London but was not the official Labour candidate. He won the election as an independent and became a popular mayor. He was allowed to rejoin the party in 2004 and won the next election for mayor. As mayor of London (2000–2008) he was known for introducing the congestion charge, a payment which drivers have to make if they want to drive in certain parts of the city."}

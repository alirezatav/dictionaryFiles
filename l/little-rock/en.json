{"word[0]":"Little Rock","definition[0]":"the capital of the US state of Arkansas. It is known especially as the place where, in 1957, the US president had to send US government soldiers to a school, because the state governor was using Arkansas state soldiers to prevent nine black children from going to a school where all the children were white. Bill Clinton lived in Little Rock when he was the state governor of Arkansas, before he became president of the US."}

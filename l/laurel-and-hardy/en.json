{"word[0]":"Laurel and Hardy","definition[0]":"two US comedians, Stan Laurel (1890–1965), who was born in the UK, and Oliver Hardy (1892–1957), who made many humorous and popular films together from the 1920s to the 1950s. Laurel is famous for being a thin stupid character, who is easily upset, and Hardy is famous for being a fat character with a small moustache, who often gets angry with Laurel and says to him, ‘That’s another fine mess you’ve gotten me into!’ People sometimes use this expression humorously when they are blaming someone else for a problem."}

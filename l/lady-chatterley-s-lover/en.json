{"word[0]":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","definition[0]":"a novel by D. H. Lawrence which was written in 1928, but could not legally be sold in the UK until 1960 because the story contained a lot of descriptions of sex and was considered to be very shocking. It is about Lady Chatterley, a married woman from a high social class, who has a sexual relationship with her  gamekeeper (=someone whose job is to take care of wild birds that are bred to be shot for sport)."}

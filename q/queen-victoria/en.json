{"word[0]":"Victoria, Queen","definition[0]":"(1819–1901) the British queen from 1837 until her death, who also had the title ‘Empress of India’. She was queen for 64 years, longer than any other British king or queen, during a period of great change. While she was queen, the UK became one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world, as a result of the growth of industry and the development of the British Empire. When people think now of the ‘Victorian’ period, it is often seen as a time of strict moral standards, when people were very serious, marriages were always permanent, and sex was never mentioned. Victoria herself is supposed to have said ‘We are not amused’ when someone told her something funny. Victoria was married to a German prince, Prince Albert, and his sudden death in 1861 caused her great and lasting unhappiness."}

{"word[0]":"Waltons, The","definition[0]":"a 1970s US television programme about a large family called the Waltons, living in the state of Virginia in the 1930s. The best known character is the oldest child, John-Boy, who writes in his diary about what happens to his family. The stories and morals of the programme are rather old-fashioned, and people sometimes mention the Waltons as an example of a ‘perfect’ family that is not very realistic."}

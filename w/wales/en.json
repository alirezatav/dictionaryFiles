{"word[0]":"Wales","definition[0]":"a country in the United Kingdom, west of England, which was an independent country until it was brought under English rule in 1284. Population: 3,063,758 (2014). Capital: Cardiff. The country's Welsh name is Cymru. Wales is known for its high mountains, including Snowdon, and it is a popular place for tourists to visit. Traditionally, its main industries were farming, especially sheep farming and, in South Wales, coal mining (=getting coal out of the earth). The mines have now all closed, but new industries are being developed, especially making electronic products. The Welsh language is spoken by many people, especially in the north. The Welsh Assembly was established in 1999 in order to give the Welsh people more power to govern themselves while still being part of the UK. Some people, including the political party Plaid Cymru, want Wales to be an independent country. Welsh people are thought to be good singers, and Wales is known for its male voice choirs. The national symbols of Wales are the leek (=a vegetable with a long white stem and long flat green leaves), the daffodil (=a tall yellow spring flower), and the red dragon. The patron saint is Saint David."}

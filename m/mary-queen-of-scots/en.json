{"word[0]":"Mary Queen of Scots","definition[0]":"(1542â€“87) the daughter of the Scottish King James V. She became Queen of Scotland when she was one week old, but in 1568 she was forced to give up her position, and she escaped to England. Instead of helping her, the English queen, Elizabeth I (who was her cousin)  put her in prison. Many Catholics believed Mary should have been Queen of England instead of Elizabeth, who was a Protestant. Eventually Elizabeth ordered Mary to be killed, because she believed Mary was involved in a secret plan to kill her. After Elizabeth's death, Mary's son James, who was the King of Scotland, also became the King of England (as James I). Mary had three husbands, and had an exciting and romantic life, and many stories and books have been written about her."}

The programme is known for the large black leather chair that each person sits in to answer their questions. If someone does not know the answer to a question, they say ‘Pass’ and the presenter, (1972–97 Magnus Magnusson, John Humphries 2004-) then asks the next question. If the time for a person’s questions finishes while the presenter is in the middle of a question, he says ‘I’ve started so I’ll finish’, and then continues with the question. People use both these expressions in a humorous way."}

{"word[0]":"Muhammad","definition[0]":"(?570–632) the Arab prophet, who was born in Makkah (Mecca) and who started the religion of Islam. The things that God told him were later written down to form the holy book called the Quran (Koran). The calendar which is used in the Islamic world, the Hegira calendar, begins in 622 AD, which is the year when Muhammad went from Makkah to Medina to escape from being badly treated for his religious beliefs. When Muslim people mention Muhammad’s name, they usually add the words ‘peace be upon him’ in order to show their respect."}

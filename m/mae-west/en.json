{"word[0]":"Mae West","definition[0]":"a humorous name for a type of life jacket (=an air-filled piece of clothing that you wear to stop yourself sinking in water) that was worn in World War II by people in the air force. It was given this name because its shape reminded people of the film actress Mae West, who was known for her large breasts.","definition[1]":"(1892–1980) a US film actress, famous for being sexually attractive, whose films include She Done Him Wrong  (1933) and I’m No Angel  (1933). She is known especially for making clever, amusing remarks which are really about sex but which seem to have more than one meaning. She is supposed to have said ‘Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?’ She is remembered especially for saying ‘Come up and see me sometime’, although the words she actually used were ‘Why don’t you come up sometime and see me?’"}

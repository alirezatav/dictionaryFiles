{"word[0]":"McLuhan, Marshall","definition[0]":"(1911–80) a Canadian writer who was interested in the media (=newspapers, radio, and television), and is known for inventing the phrase ‘the medium is the message’, by which he meant that the way in which people receive information has more influence on what they think than the information itself. He also said that the world was becoming a ‘global village’, meaning that telecommunications were making the world seem smaller and that the countries of the world were becoming more dependent on one another."}

{"word[0]":"Michelin Guide","definition[0]":"a type of guidebook produced by the French company Michelin, which contains information for tourists visiting places in Europe and the US. The green guides contain maps and information about interesting places to visit, especially in Europe and the US, and the red guides contain lists of restaurants and hotels in Europe, which are given one, two, or three stars, according to a system for judging their quality. A restaurant with three Michelin stars is regarded as extremely good, and very few restaurants achieve this."}

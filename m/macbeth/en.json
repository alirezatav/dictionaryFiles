{"word[0]":"Macbeth","definition[0]":"a character in the play Macbeth by William Shakespeare. Macbeth is told by three witches (witch) that he will become king. To do so, he murders the present king Duncan, who is visiting him in his castle. Although he feels very guilty about this, he kills several other people to keep his power until he is finally killed by Macduff. Actors believe it is unlucky to say the name Macbeth, so they often call it The Scottish Play."}

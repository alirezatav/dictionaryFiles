{"word[0]":"Miami","definition[0]":"a city in the southeast of Florida, in the US. It is known for having warm weather and pleasant beaches, and is very popular with tourists. A lot of people in Miami come from Hispanic  (=Spanish-speaking) countries, including many from Cuba, who came to Miami because they disliked Castro's communist government. Because of its large Hispanic population and its nearness to Latin America, many companies in Miami do a lot of business with companies in Central and South America. During the 1980s, the city became known as a centre of the illegal drugs trade, and in the past it had more murders than most other US cities."}

{"word[0]":"Concorde","definition[0]":"a type of passenger aircraft, which flew at twice the speed of sound and was the fastest in the world. Concorde was a long thin plane with a long pointed front. It was built by British and French designers and engineers working together, and both British Airways and Air France provided flights on Concorde, which were expensive but fashionable. In 2003, British Airways and Air France stopped flying Concorde because the planes had become old and it was too expensive to build more"}

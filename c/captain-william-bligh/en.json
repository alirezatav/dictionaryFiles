{"word[0]":"Bligh, Captain William","definition[0]":"(1754-?1817) an officer in the British navy who was in command of the ship HMS Bounty. Bligh was unpopular because he was a very cruel and strict leader, so the men on his ship attacked him, took power from him, and made him leave in a small boat. The film Mutiny on the Bounty is about this story, but some people now believe that Captain Bligh was not as cruel as shown in this story."}

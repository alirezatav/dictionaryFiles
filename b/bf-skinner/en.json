{"word[0]":"Skinner, B.F.","definition[0]":"(1904–90) a US psychologist (=a scientist who studies the way the human mind works) who developed the ideas of behaviourism. He did a lot of experiments, especially with animals, to see how they behaved in certain situations and how they could be trained to change their behaviour. He also invented ‘programmed learning’, a teaching method which influenced the way that languages and other subjects were taught in the 1970s, although most teachers now think that Skinner’s method was wrong."}

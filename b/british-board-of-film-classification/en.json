{"word[0]":"British Board of Film Classification, the","definition[0]":"a special committee in the UK whose job is to watch new films and decide whether children or young people will be allowed to see them. They give each film a certificate, showing which films can be shown to anyone (U), which can be seen by children if an adult goes with them (PG), and which films can only be seen by people over a particular age (12,15, and 18). For example, a film with an ‘18’ certificate probably has a lot of sex and violence in it, so can only be seen by people who are at least 18 years old. The Board also gives certificates to DVDs and computer games. There is a similar organization in the US called the Motion Picture Association of America."}

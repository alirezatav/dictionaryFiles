Clinton was a popular president for most of his period in office, because the US economy was strong. His reputation was hurt by claims that he had been involved in dishonest business deals, and especially by claims made by several women that he had had secret sexual relationships with them. In 1998, he admitted that he had had ‘an inappropriate relationship’ with Monica Lewinsky while she was working as an intern in the White House in 1995. Clinton’s wife is Hillary Rodham Clinton."}

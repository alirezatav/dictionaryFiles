{"word[0]":"Butler Report, the","definition[0]":"a report which was prepared for the British Government by a committee led by Lord Butler, an important civil servant, and which was published in July 2004. The Government had asked Butler to examine the intelligence (=information about the secret activities of government, the military plans of an enemy etc) about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction on which the government had based its decision to join a coalition (=group of armies from different countries) led by the US which invaded Iraq in 2003. The report said that important intelligence had been unreliable (=could not be trusted) and that the Intelligence Service which had advised the government had not checked its sources (=the people it got information from) carefully enough."}

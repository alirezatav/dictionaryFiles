They are called Jedward because their real names are John and Edward Grimes. They first became famous after taking part in the television talent show The X Factor in 2009. They have been criticized for not singing well, but some people find their performances entertaining. They are known for having large quiffs (=1950s style hairstyles in which the hair is combed high above their heads). They represented Ireland at the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest."}

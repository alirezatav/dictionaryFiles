{"word[0]":"Jericho","definition[0]":"a city in Israel, north of the Dead Sea, thought to be the oldest city in the world. According to the Old Testament of the Bible, it was attacked by Joshua, the leader of the Israelites, and his army shouted and blew their trumpets so loudly that the walls of the city fell down. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel took Jericho from Jordan, but in 1994 it became part of the Palestinian National Authority as result of the Middle East peace process."}

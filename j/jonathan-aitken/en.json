Aitken sued The Guardian newspaper and Granada Television who had made this accusation, but it was discovered that he had lied in court and he was sent to prison. In prison he became very interested in the Christian religion. After leaving prison, he wanted to return to politics, but the leader of the Conservative Party at that time, Michael Howard, did not allow him to do this. Later, in 2007, he was leader of a group of Conservative politicians who suggested ideas for changing the prison system."}

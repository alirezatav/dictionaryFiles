{"word[0]":"Forrest Gump","definition[0]":"(1994) a humorous US film in which Tom Hanks appears as a man called Forrest Gump, who is nice but not very intelligent. As a result of good luck, he becomes successful and rich, and so achieves the things that many Americans think are important, though these things are not important to him. Gump is known for often repeating his mother’s saying that ‘Life is like a box of chocolates’, meaning that when you make a choice in life, you do not know whether it will be a good choice or not."}

Members often have two homes - one in their constituency, and one in London near Parliament. They are allowed to claim special allowances for their second home. Some MPs change which home they say is their second home, so that they can claim as much money as possible and avoid paying tax when they sell their second home. This practice is known as ‘flipping’."}

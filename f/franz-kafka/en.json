{"word[0]":"Kafka, Franz","definition[0]":"(1883â€“1924) a Czech writer who wrote in German, known for his novels such as The Trial and The Castle, and his short stories such as Metamorphosis, in which a man turns into a large and ugly insect.

The word Kafkaesque is used to describe this type of experience, in which you feel that no one understands you and there is no way of escaping from an unpleasant situation."}

He lost an arm and the sight in one eye during the wars against Napoleon, and he became very popular after winning several important battles at sea. His most famous battle was the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, in which he was killed. Before the battle he said to his men ‘England expects that every man will do his duty’, and as he lay dying he is believed to have said ‘Kiss me, Hardy’ to his friend Sir Thomas Hardy. He is also known for having a romantic affair with an upper-class woman called Lady Hamilton. After his death, Trafalgar Square and Nelson’s Column were built to honour him."}

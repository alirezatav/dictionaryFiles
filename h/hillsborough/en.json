{"word[0]":"Hillsborough","definition[0]":"a serious accident which happened in 1989 during a football game at Hillsborough, in the city of Sheffield in northern England. 96 people died and several hundred were injured by being crushed when a large crowd of people moved into a small area and could not escape. This event led to changes in the design of football grounds and in the methods used for controlling large crowds safely. A report in 2012 said that the actions of the police were largely responsible for the event, and some police officers had made false statements about their actions."}

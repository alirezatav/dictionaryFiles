{"word[0]":"Harlem","definition[0]":"an area of New York City in northeast Manhattan, where many African-American and Hispanic people live. In the past it was known as a centre for music, especially jazz. For many years it was thought of as a poor area with a lot of crime, and many white people were afraid to go there. Now parts of Harlem are considered to be desirable places to live."}

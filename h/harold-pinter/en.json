{"word[0]":"Pinter, Harold","definition[0]":"(1930â€“2008)  a British writer of plays, whose best-known works include The Birthday Party and The Caretaker. In Pinter's plays, actors have very realistic conversations, often with long silences, and they often misunderstand each other.

He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005."}

{"word[0]":"Macmillan, Harold","definition[0]":"(1894–1986) a British politician in the Conservative Party, who was prime minister from 1957 to 1963, during a period of great economic improvement. He made two expressions popular in the UK, when he told the British people ‘You’ve never had it so good’ (meaning that most people had more money and a better life than they ever had before), and when he talked about ‘the winds of change’ blowing through Africa (meaning that many African countries were becoming independent from Great Britain at that time). He later became Lord Stockton."}

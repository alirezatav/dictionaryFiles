{"word[0]":"Nuremberg","definition[0]":"an industrial city in Bavaria, southern Germany, whose German name is Nürnberg. For many people, Nuremberg is connected with the Nuremberg Rallies of 1930s, when the Nazi Party held very large well-organized public meetings, with large numbers of soldiers marching in regular patterns, and nationalistic speeches by Adolf Hitler. In 1945–46 the Nuremberg Trials took place there, when many Nazi leaders were judged in a court of law for their war crimes, and some of them were punished by death."}

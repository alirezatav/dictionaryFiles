{"word[0]":"New Labour","definition[0]":"an unofficial name for the British Labour Party that was used especially by Tony Blair and his supporters to show that the Labour Party has changed some of its ideas and become more modern. One of the main New Labour ideas is that the government should not use high taxes to pay for public services. Many people believe these changes made Labour more popular and led to its success in the 1997 elections in the UK. But some traditional supporters of the party believe it has become too right wing."}

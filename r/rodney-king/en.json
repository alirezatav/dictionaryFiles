{"word[0]":"King, Rodney","definition[0]":"(1965â€“2012) an African-American man who was violently attacked by a group of white police officers in Los Angeles in 1991. The attack was filmed by a member of the public, and this film was later shown on US television. When the police officers were judged in a court of law in 1992, the jury decided that they were not guilty of being too violent, and this led to riots (=violent public protests) in Los Angeles. Many people in the US thought that this event proved that African Americans were still not being treated fairly by the legal system."}

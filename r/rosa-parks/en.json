{"word[0]":"Parks, Rosa","definition[0]":"(1913â€“2005) an African-American woman who became famous in 1955 because she refused to give her seat on a bus to a white man. This action was illegal in the US state of Alabama and she was arrested by the police. As a result Martin Luther King persuaded people not to use these buses, and in 1956 the US Supreme Court said that segregation (=keeping black people separate from white people) on buses was not legal. Rosa Parks' action is therefore seen as an important event in the Civil Rights Movement."}

{"word[0]":"Republic of Ireland, the","definition[0]":"a country that forms the larger part of the island of Ireland, which is a member of the EU (European Union). Population: 4,775,982 (2014). Capital: Dublin. It was formerly ruled by the British, but it became an independent country in 1921 after a long fight, when Ireland was divided into Northern Ireland (which remained as part of the UK) and the Irish Free State, which later became the Republic of Ireland. Ireland is mainly a Roman Catholic country, and its patron saint is Saint Patrick and its national symbol is the shamrock. Its official languages are Irish Gaelic and English. Traditionally, Irelandâ€™s main industry was farming, and many Irish people left the country to find work abroad, especially in the UK and the US. Ireland is known for its beautiful countryside, mountains, and coasts, so tourism is an important industry. The Irish are typically thought of as friendly people who enjoy conversation and are good talkers. They are known for their pubs, where people drink Guiness  (=a dark beer) and listen to Irish folk music. Many famous writers, such as James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, and George Bernard Shaw come from Ireland."}

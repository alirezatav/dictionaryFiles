{"word[0]":"Murdoch, Rupert","definition[0]":"(1931–) a powerful businessman, born in Australia but now a US citizen, who controls one of the world’s largest media businesses, News Corporation, which owns newspapers, television companies, film companies, and book publishers. These include many British, US, and Australian newspapers (such as the New York Post and The Times,  Sky TV, and the Fox film company). Some people criticize Murdoch because they believe his control of so many media companies gives him too much power. In 2012, he resigned as a  director of  News International  after a newspaper owned by the company was found to have been secretly reading and listening to messages on people's  mobile phones."}

Because of the long connection between India and the UK, the two countries have had a great influence on each other's culture. Many British people are of Indian origin (=they were born in India or their parents, grandparents etc were born in India), and Indian food is very popular in the UK. There have also been many well-known books, films, TV programmes etc about the British in India."}

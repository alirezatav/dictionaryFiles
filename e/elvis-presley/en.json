{"word[0]":"Presley, Elvis","definition[0]":"(1935–77) a US singer and guitar player, who first became popular as a rock ‘n’ roll singer in the mid-1950s, and became one of the most successful and popular singers ever. As a young man, he was known for being sexually attractive and was called ‘Elvis the Pelvis’ because of the way he moved the lower part of his body when he performed. Later, his performances became less active and exciting, and he sang mostly slow love songs. His many successful records had a great influence on popular music, and they include Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Suede Shoes, and Are you Lonesome Tonight? He also appeared in many films, such as Jailhouse Rock (1957) and G.I. Blues (1960). He is often called ‘The King’, and some people say that they do not believe that he is dead. Millions of people go to visit his home in Memphis, Tennessee, which is called Graceland."}

{"word[0]":"Old Labour","definition[0]":"an unofficial name used to talk about the British Labour Party before it was changed by Tony Blair in the 1990s. Old Labour was thought to be more left wing, and supported the idea of increasing taxes to pay for public services such as education and health. Today the Labour Party does not believe in increasing taxes, and many traditional Labour supporters think it has become too right wing."}

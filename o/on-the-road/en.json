{"word[0]":"On the Road","definition[0]":"a novel by Jack Kerouac about a journey across the US. Many people believe that the novel is autobiographical and that the two main characters are really Kerouac and his friend Neal Cassady. On the Road is considered to be the most important book of the Beat Generation. It is known for its unusual style: sentences are often very long, but are split into regular repeated patterns, using commas, and this makes the language of the novel sound like jazz music.","definition[1]":"travelling in a car, especially for long distances","example[0]":"I’ve been on the road since 5:00 a.m. this morning.","definition[2]":"if a group of actors or musicians are on the road, they are travelling from place to place giving performances","example[1]":"They’re on the road for six months out of every year.","definition[3]":"if your car is on the road, you have paid for the repairs, tax etc necessary for you to drive it legally","example[2]":"It would cost too much to put it back on the road."}

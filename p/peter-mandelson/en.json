From 1987 to 1997, he was in charge of planning and organizing all the party's election attempts, and he is thought of as a typical example of a spin doctor (=someone who tries to influence news reporting so that it is always favourable to his party). He became a member of the Cabinet after the 1997 election. In 1998 he was forced to leave his job because of a financial scandal, but after a year he came back into the Cabinet. In 2001 he had to leave the Cabinet again after another scandal. In 2004 the Prime Minister Tony Blair made him a European commissioner. During the time when Gordon Brown was prime minister, Mandelson was given various jobs including being secretary of state for Business, Innovation and Skills.

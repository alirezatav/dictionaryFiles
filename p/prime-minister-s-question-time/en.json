{"word[0]":"Prime Minister's Question Time","definition[0]":"a period of time each week when any member of the British House of Commons may ask the prime minister questions. It used to take place every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, but since 1997 there has been just one longer Question Time each week. There are often loud and angry disagreements during Question Time, which are broadcast on radio and television, and many people feel that the arguing and interrupting shows one of the worst features of the British political system."}

{"word[0]":"Plymouth Colony","definition[0]":"the second English town to be built in North America, in 1620, (=the first was in Jamestow, Virginia), in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts. The settlers, known as the Pilgrim Fathers, were Puritans who sailed on the ship Mayflower from Plymouth, England. Only half of them were still alive after the first winter in America, but the town grew. According to old stories, the settlersâ€™ first steps when they landed in America were on a large rock, today called Plymouth Rock."}

{"word[0]":"Pareto-optimal","definition[0]":"if available RESOURCEs (=things that you need to make or do something) have been given to people in a Pareto-optimal way, this is the most effective way of using them. In this situation, it is impossible to put one person in a better position by giving them more resources, without putting someone else in a worse position. In practice, resources are rarely given out in a Pareto-optimal way","example[0]":"The government thinks that the distribution of financial resources is Pareto-optimal because different departments compete for resources."}

{"word[0]":"Daniel","definition[0]":"in the Old Testament of the Bible, a Jewish man who was made a prisoner by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and was put into a lions' den as a punishment for not changing his beliefs. The lions did not kill him, however, because God protected him. The phrase in the lion's den comes from this story, and is used to describe a difficult situation in which you are surrounded by people who are your enemies."}

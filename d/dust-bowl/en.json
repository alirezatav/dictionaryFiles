As a result, many farmers became very poor and had to leave their farms. Some of them travelled to the west coast of the US to find work, and these events are described in John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath.","definition[2]":"an area of land where farming is not possible because it is too dry, used especially to talk about parts of the mid-western United States during the 1930s","example[0]":"Many Americans abandoned the dust bowl in search of jobs."}

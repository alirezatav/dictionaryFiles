{"word[0]":"Livingstone, Dr David","definition[0]":"(1813–73) a Scottish missionary (=someone who goes to a foreign country to teach people about Christianity) and explorer of Africa. He was the first European to see the Zambezi River and the Victoria Falls. A journalist called Henry Morton Stanley, who did not know Livingstone, went to look for him.

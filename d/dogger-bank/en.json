{"word[0]":"Dogger Bank","definition[0]":"an area of the North Sea, about 70 miles (110 kilometres) off the coast of northeast England, where the sea is not very deep because there is a large sandbank (=raised area of sand in the sea) under the water. It used to be known as a place where lots of boats went to catch fish, but the amount of fishing allowed is much more limited now."}

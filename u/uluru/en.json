{"word[0]":"Uluru","definition[0]":"a very large red rock in the Northern Territory, Australia, which is the world's largest monolith (=block of stone). It was formerly known as Ayers Rock, but the original Australian Aboriginal name for it, Uluru, is now preferred. Many tourists visit it because it is a beautiful and mysterious place, and it changes colour when the sunlight shines on it."}

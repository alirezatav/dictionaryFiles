{"word[0]":"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi","definition[0]":"(1952-) a Libyan man who was found guilty by a special court in the Netherlands in 2001 of putting a bomb on a plane which caused the death of 270 people on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Some legal experts and journalists have, however, expressed doubts about whether the guilty decision was correct. Al-Megrahi was put in prison, but the Scottish government let him go free and return to Libya in 2009 after doctors discovered that he had cancer and was expected to live for only a few months more. The decision to release al-Megrahi was very controversial (=caused a lot of argument), especially in the US."}

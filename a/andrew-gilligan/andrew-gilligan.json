{"word[0]":"Gilligan, Andrew","definition[0]":"(1968â€“) a British reporter who worked for the BBC. After he had spoken to Dr David Kelly, an expert on weapons, he said on the radio that a government report had been changed in order to convince people that Iraq could use dangerous weapons very quickly, and make them believe that a war against Iraq was a good thing to do. Dr David Kelly killed himself after it became known that he had supplied the information for Gilligan's claim. In January 2004 the Hutton Inquiry into the reasons for Kelly's death criticized Gilligan and the BBC for not reporting the facts correctly. As a result, the chairman of the BBC and its director-general decided to leave their jobs, and shortly afterwards Gilligan left his job."}

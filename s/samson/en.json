{"word[0]":"Samson","definition[0]":"a very strong man who is a great fighter and whose story is in the Bible. A woman called Delilah finds out that his strength comes from his long hair, and she uses her sexual power to trick Samson into having his hair cut off. This allows his enemies, the Philistines, to make him a prisoner and blind him. His strength returns when his hair grows again, and he destroys the Philistines' temple by pulling down the pillars that hold the roof up, killing himself and his enemies."}

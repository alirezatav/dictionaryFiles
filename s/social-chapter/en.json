{"word[0]":"Social Chapter, the","definition[0]":"a document produced by the EU (=European Union) and agreed upon by all the member countries, which contains details of the most important employment and social rights that should be available in these countries. The document includes rules about working hours, working conditions, and payment for work, health and safety, equal treatment between men and women, and the protection of children and young people. For many years, the Conservative government in the UK refused to sign the Social Chapter because it made the minimum wage law but this policy was changed in 1997 when the Labour Party became the government."}

{"word[0]":"Skye","definition[0]":"an island off the northwest coast of Scotland. It is the largest island of the Inner Hebrides, has many mountains, and is regarded as a very beautiful and romantic place. It is also known because of an old popular song called The Skye Boat Song  which contains the words ‘over the sea to Skye’. Before a bridge was built across the sea to Skye in the 1990s, the island could only be reached by boat, but the bridge has caused a lot of protest, because it costs a lot to use it."}

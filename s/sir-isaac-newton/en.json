{"word[0]":"Newton, Sir Isaac","definition[0]":"(1642â€“1727) a British physicist and mathematician who is best known for discovering gravity (=the force that causes things to fall towards the ground or to be pulled towards stars or planets in space). He made many other important scientific discoveries, and is considered to be one of the most important scientists who ever lived. Until the early 20th century, modern physics was based on Newton's work, and it is sometimes called Newtonian physics. He is often shown in pictures holding an apple, because there is a story that he discovered the law of gravity when an apple fell on his head while he was sitting under a tree."}

{"word[0]":"Shakers, the","definition[0]":"a Christian religious group that started in England in 1747 and was established in the US in 1774. They were called the Shakers because they were known for shaking with emotion during their religious meetings. Members live together and work in their own villages, and are known for farming, making strong but simple furniture, believing men and women are equal, and choosing to be celibate (=not having sex). Because new members were not accepted after the 1960s and 1970s, there were only a few Shakers alive in the 1990s."}

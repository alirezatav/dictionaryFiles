{"word[0]":"Stormont","definition[0]":"a castle in Belfast where the Northern Ireland Parliament used to meet. An independent Parliament for Northern Ireland was started there in 1921 but as a result of serious violence in 1969, it was ended by the British government, which continued to rule Northern Ireland from London. Since 1998, Stormont has been used for meetings of the Northern Ireland Assembly which was established as a result of peace talks. The Assembly has, however, been closed at different times because of disagreements between the political parties."}

{"word[0]":"Standard Oil","definition[0]":"a large US oil company established in the 19th century by John D. Rockefeller. In 1911 it was divided into about 30 smaller companies because it controlled the American oil industry and the US Supreme Court judged that the company was too powerful. Some of the smaller companies that were formed are still called Standard Oil, and the name ‘Esso’ (=S.O.)  also comes from Standard Oil."}

{"word[0]":"Paul, Saint","definition[0]":"(?3AD-?68AD) a Christian apostle (=someone chosen by Jesus to teach and spread the Christian religion) whose original name was Saul of Tarsus. As a young man he refused to accept Christian beliefs and treated Christians very cruelly. He was sent to Damascus to punish the Christians who lived there, but on his way there a very bright light suddenly appeared and he heard Jesus ask ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?’ He then became a Christian, changed his name to Paul, and spent the rest of his life teaching people about Jesus. He wrote many of the epistles in the New Testament of the Bible."}

{"word[0]":"the Tohoku earthquake","definition[0]":"a very powerful earthquake that took place on 11 March 2011 off the northeast coast of Japan near the island of Honshu. It caused a tsunami that hit the land a few minutes after the earthquake, and waves travelled as far as 10 kilometres inland. Many thousands of people died and a huge amount of damage was caused to buildings, roads, and railways. Damage to nuclear power plants in Fukushima made a lot of people worried about radiation escaping into the surrounding area. It was the most powerful earthquake to have ever hit Japan."}

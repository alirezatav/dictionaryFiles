{"word[0]":"Texas","definition[0]":"a large state in the south of the US, which has a long border with Mexico. It is an important centre of the oil and gas industries, and also of cattle and crop farming. Its cities include Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, and El Paso. Before it became part of the US in 1845, Texas was briefly an independent country. Partly because of this, Texans are very proud of their state and often feel that they are different from other people in the US. When people think of Texas, they often think of cowboys and of the oil industry. It is also sometimes thought of as the place where everything is bigger than anywhere else."}

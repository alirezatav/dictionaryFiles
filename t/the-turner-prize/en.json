{"word[0]":"the Turner Prize","definition[0]":"a prize which is given each year to a British artist under the age of 50. A prize-giving event is held at Tate Britain, an art gallery in London. Past winners have included Anish Kapoor (1991), Rachel Whiteread (1993), and Grayson Perry (2003). Since the prize was first awarded in 1984, some of the works in the competition have been very controversial  (=caused a lot of disagreement among people). For example, in 1992 Damien Hirst showed a work consisting of a shark kept in formaldehyde, and in 1999 Tracey Eminâ€™s work called My Bed was actually her unmade bed. The prize is named after the painter J.M.W. Turner."}

{"word[0]":"the Arab Spring","definition[0]":"a phrase used in the media to describe the series of revolutions and protests in the Middle East and North Africa which began in December 2010 and continued into 2011. The protests began in Tunisia where President Ben Ali was removed from power. In Libya, protests against Muammar Gaddafi developed into a civil war. In Egypt, President Mubarak resigned as leader after 18 days of demonstrations. Major protests took place in many other countries in the region, often causing powerful leaders to make important political and economic changes. For example, in Jordan King Abdullah II removed the Prime Minister and the Cabinet from their jobs. Some leaders, such as President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, did not try to be re-elected."}

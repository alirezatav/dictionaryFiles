{"word[0]":"the Iraq War","definition[0]":"a war that began in March 2003 when an army led by the US (under President George W. Bush) and the UK (under Prime Minister Tony Blair) attacked Iraq. Before the war, the US and UK governments claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) which threatened the safety of their countries. This was one of the main reasons for the war. However, no weapons like these were ever found. The former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was caught, sent to a court of law, and later executed by the new Iraqi government. The number of foreign soldiers was reduced and all U.S. soldiers left Iraq in 2011. The Iraq War is also known as the War in Iraq and the Second Gulf War."}
